Master - remote control
Slave - car itself
**master module is already configured to bind to slave module. 

Code for master: 
- reads joystick
- sends message from master to slave according to diff joystick vals
- fwd is if y is less than 200 ish --> sends ascii '0'
- bckwd is if y is more than 900 ish --> sends ascii '1'
- right if x is more than 900 ish --> sends ascii '2'
-left if x is less than 200 ish --> sends ascii '3' 
- stay still if any other value --> sends ascii '4'

- master also receives a signal from the slave module if data is sending properly. 
- if data sends properly --> yellow led lights. 
- if there is some error --> red led lights. 

Code for slave: 
- receives ascii characters from master bluetooth module. 
- according to diff characters, powers motors a certain way. 
- when receives '0', all motors move fwd. 
- when receives '1', all motors move bckwd. 
- when receives '2', only motors on right move fwd. 
- when receives '3', only motors on left move fwd. 
-OPTIONAL: has code for beeper and ultrasonic sensor.
